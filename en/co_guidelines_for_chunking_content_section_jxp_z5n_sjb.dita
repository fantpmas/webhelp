<title>Include enough information</title>
<conbody>
<p id="p_qxp_z5n_sjb">The first challenge in topic-based authoring is chunking your content into discrete topics. It can be hard to determine the ideal length of a topic: it should be short enough to answer a single question yet still include enough information to stand on its own. Additionally, you should also keep in mind Millerâ€™s law when chunking your content.</p>
